# bias-variance

Bias-variance is an introductory project that performs linear regression using gradient descent to map water flowing out of a damn compared to the change in water level.
I also demonstrate the validation and test error learning curves.
The curves end up close together, but at a high error. This indicates the model is underfitting (high bias) and should use a more complex function.
